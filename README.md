## About

vAmiga emulates a Commodore Amiga 500, 1000, or 2000 on your Mac.

## Status

Development begun in January 2019 and the emulator is currently in beta testing. Bug reports on GitHub are greatly appreciated.
   
## Third-party gamepad support

At present, the emulator supports only a limited number of third-party game controllers. However, I am trying to expand the list of supported devices constantly. Since I can only make the necessary code changes for devices in my possession, I have created an [Amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/35K6X4B0FIEOF?ref_=wl_share) containing a number of yet incompatible devices. If you want to have another controller supported, please let me know the exact model name. I will then add it to the wishlist, and with a bit of luck, a noble donor will be found who will order the device.
